# python-api-challenge
Use Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"



## Part I - WeatherPy

Create a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator utilizing a [simple Python library and the  [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude

The graph depicts the max temperatures for cities as they are closer or father away from the Equator ( 0 degrees latitude). Per the image above, one can notice that the Temperature seems to rise the closer the city is to the Equator (0 degrees latitude)

Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

The graph depicts the humidity for cities as they are closer or father away from the Equator ( 0 degrees latitude). In the case of humidity levels for a city. It seems that latitude is not a major factor. There is no significant change in the humidity levels as the cities are further or closer to the Equator. 

Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude

The graph depicts the level of "cloudiness" for cities as they are closer or father away from the Equator ( 0 degrees latitude).  Per the scatter plot, it seems that latitude does not have a significant effect on how cloudy a city is or not. 

Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

The graph depicts the speed of wind for cities as they are closer or father away from the Equator ( 0 degrees latitude). Again, the results do not demonstrate a significant relation between the closeness to the equator and how "windy" a city is.
